# Place for small projects for both useful purposes as well as expanding coding acumen
# This first project is an attempt to organize my University's Major and Minor course offerings into a an easily accesible 
# form that students can use to plan a career trajectory. 
# Students often spend their first few semesters experimenting with different interests and they do this by taking a variety of different # classes. The goal of this project is to allow students to enter their completed courses (or future courses) into a program and hae the # program show them all the different ways that those courses can be applied to a major or a minor in a visual format (think of a family # tree type of diagram).
